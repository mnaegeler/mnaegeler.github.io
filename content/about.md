I am a web developer since 2012, starting with front-end development. In the very beginning focused on learn the pure JavaScript.

Now I work with Node.js, PHP, SQL and NoSQL databases and at the moment, I'm learning DartLang.

I love to learn new languages and get to express myself in better ways. I speak English, Spanish and Portuguese and right now I'm learning German and French.

My current studies in programming languages and frameworks involves the Flutter Framework, Ionic, Firebase, UX and UI design (I'm improving my skills) and (even more) JavaScript.

I love to be different, help people with their struggles, making solutions to transform people's lives and cooking.
